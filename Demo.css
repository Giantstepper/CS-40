/*
 Can use CSS to have control over the layout and presentation of 
 web pages.  A CSS contains lines of selectors.  A selector is of
 the following form:

     selector (property:value)

 Each line below is a selector declaration. 

 An id is defined using a pound sign (#), e.g., #me below, which 
 can then be used like this: id="me". 

 Universal class 'pink' is defined below as if it was a tag.  You can 
 then reference the class with class="pink". 

 Difference between one defined with a pound sign and one defined with
 a dot, e.g., #foo and .bar
   - #foo is to control one element, unique on a page
   - .bar is to control one class of elements

 All these are described in more detail in democss.html file, which uses
 this file (demo.css).
