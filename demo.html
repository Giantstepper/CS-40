I have commented out most of the content of this file.

When you study this file, do the following:

1. Uncomment the <title>...</title> tag and see what it does.
2. Unveil a small portion of the body part of this document at a time
   by moving the line labeled "Line **************" below.

   That way you will be able to see what part of the code generates
   what part of the output in the web browser window.
   I have already unveiled one line starting with <center>...

<center><h1>A Quick Introduction</h1></center>




<center><h3 style="color:red">to HTML</h3></center>

<p><b style="color:red">Try "View Page Source" on this page with a
  right click!</b>  If you are using a web browser that does not
  show <b>View Page Source</b> as one of the menu options, e.g., on
  Safari, then google something like <tt>How to view page souce on
  Safari</tt>. (Actually, on Safafi try Safari; Preferences; check on
  "Show Develop menu in menu bar", then you will see "Show Page
  Source" on a right click, or 2-finger click.)</p>

<p>By the way, what editor are you using? You should use a plain text
  editor.  MS Word is <i>not</i> a plain text editor.  You can use
  <b>Subline Text 2</b> or <b>emacs</b> to create an HTML file.</p> 

<hr>

<p>Writing paragraphs.</p>

<p>Let's start with a plain looking paragraph.</p>

<p>Another one with some tags like <i>itatlic</i> and <b>bold</b>
  and <tt>teletype</tt> fonts and <u>underlined</u> text as a few
  examples.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Start with some blank spaces on this line
  to get an indented look. BTW, nbsp stands for non-breaking space.
  Try googling it to see exactly what it is used for.</p>

<p>If you need more info on HTML, see the tutorial link on the course
  web.</p>

<p>If you want me to include that link here, we can do that as well
  like this:

</p>

<hr>
Ways to emphasize:<br /><p />

<strong>This</strong> is a stronger emphasis than <i>this italic
  emphasis</i> or <small>this small emphasis</small>. You can
  emphasize <em>like this</em> as well.  You can <mark>mark some
  text</mark> with the <tt>mark</tt> tag.</p>

<p>Here <span style="color:red">is
another way to emphasize</span> using the <tt>span</tt> tag.</p>

<p>Using the <tt>del</tt> tag, you can <del>delete some text but leave 
  it</del> as part of the document. Use the <tt>ins</tt> tag to
  <ins>insert some text</ins> in your document.</p>

<p>Add a <sup>superscript</sup> or <sub>subscript</sub> as you
  please.</p>

<hr/>
An unordered list:
<ul>
 <li style="color:red"> One</li>
 <li> Two</li>
 <li> <span style="color:green">Three</span></li>
</ul>

<p/>

<hr/>
An ordered list:
<ol>
 <li>Uno</li>
 <li>Dos</li>
 <li>Tres</li>
</ol>

<hr/>
How about a table?
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=10 cellpadding=5>

 <tr>
  <th><center><b>City</b></center></th>
  <th><center><b>State</b></center></th>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Claremont</td>
  <td>California</td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>Seattle</td>
  <td>Washington</td>
 </tr>

 <caption>Caption added</caption>

</table>
</center>
<p>Try moving the caption to the bottom of the table.  How do you find
out?  Well..., how about googling something like: "caption on html
table"?</p>

<hr/>

Verbatim:
<pre style="color:red;font-size:20pt">
         This is a test
            of the 
                 pre    tag...
</pre>

<p>We can generate a short quote: <q>Go fly a kite!</q></p>

<p>We can generate a long quote using the tag <tt>blockquote</tt> like
  this:
  <blockquote>
You live in the most privileged nation on earth. You are the most
privileged citizens of that privileged nation; for you have been given
the opportunity to study and learn, to take your place among the tiny
minority of the world's educated men and women. By coming to this
school you have been lifted onto a tiny, sunlit island, while all
around you lies an ocean of human misery, injustice, violence, and
fear. You can use your enormous privilege and opportunity to seek
purely private pleasure and gain. But history will judge you, and, as
the years pass, you will ultimately judge yourself, on the extent to
which you have used your gifts to enrich the lives of your fellow
man. In your hands, not with presidents or leaders, is the future of
your world and the fulfillment of the best qualities of your own
spirit. Robert F. Kennedy (Speech to Students, University of
California at Berkeley, October 10, 1966.

  1945.</p>
